// Setup variables and constants
export var message = 'hello';
export let greeting = 'Yo!';
export let saying = 'What up?';
export const myConst = 'This is my const';

// Reassign variables
message = 'world';

// This line will throw an error, as a const is immutable
saying = 'Booyah';

// This is a single line comment.
